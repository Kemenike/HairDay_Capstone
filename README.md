# Hair Day Website
## About 
Hair day is a simple website that I created using a mock prompt from a customer. This was developed during my Meta Front-end Developer Certification Course. We had some background information on the company, what they were trying to accomplish and some of their assets they wanted to use on the site. Using the best practices in HTML and CSS, this simple site has a few pages with text, different sections, accessability information and more.
